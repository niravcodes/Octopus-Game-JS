# Octopus Game

Meet Generic Octopus. Unlike his daddy octopus and his granddaddy octopus who were quite content living in the dull blue of the coastal seas and befriending wise old turtles, this teenage octopus has Grand Dreams (as only teenagers seem to have). So he has set out on a life-changing journey to swim into the deep sea and discover new creatures.
